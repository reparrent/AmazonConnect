Testing Amazon connect:
1 log into the CCP using an incognito window and browsing to you account URL (e.g. https://ptsv.my.connect.aws/home)
  This gives you an agent to receive calls (if the agent status is "available")
  This is a different user than the developer user.  This allows you to test routing and security profiles as well.
  This will connect to my dormant iPhone via my internal home LAN.  I don't use that phone for speaking, I speak through the computer microphone.
I generally use my live cell phone to make the calls
